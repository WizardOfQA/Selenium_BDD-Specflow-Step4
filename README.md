# Selenium_UI_Automation_BDD (Specflow)
## Description:
Specflow is a .NET version of Cucumber.
We can accomplish Behavior Driven Development(BDD) using Specflow.
In BDD, we write tests first and this can be done by even non programers such as Business Analyst, manual tester, product owner, etc since it uses plain English. Then we write code to support the scenarios.
Each scenario in Specflow becomes a test case. 
In here, I converted a couple of test cases used in POM into Specflow scenarios.
This is the final step of the entire series of creating Selenium UI Automation Framework.

### Roadmap for Selenium UI Test Automation Series:
1> Selenium_UI_Automation Without POM - Manily Focus on Selenium API Functionalities  
2> Selenium_UI_Automation With POM - The Structure and Creating of POM  
3> Selenium_UI_Automation With Logging and Reporting Functionalities.(Extent Report) - How to Logging and Reporting using Extent Reports in a Selenium framework     
**4> Selenium_UI_Automation With Behavior Driven Development(BDD) Using Specflow - How to implment BDD to the framework using Specflow**

I might add more series as needed to showcase UI Automation with Selenium.  

## Specflow
### Some Advantages of Using Specflow
* Collaboration. Even without programming skill, anybody can write the test.
* Everybody is in the same page. Developers, Automation Testers, Manual Testers, Business Analyst, Managers etc.
* Feature files that contain scenarios become living documents. 
* Reduces code duplication.
* It automatically gives QA acceptance criteria.
